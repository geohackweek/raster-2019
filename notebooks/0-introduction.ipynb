    "## Data Structures: Raster and Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "The two primary types of geospatial data are raster and vector data. Vector data structures represent specific features on the Earth's surface, and assign attributes to those features. Raster data is stored as a grid of values which are rendered on a map as pixels. Each pixel value represents an area on the Earth's surface. In the 1950's raster graphics were noted as a faster and cheaper (but lower-resolution) alternative to vector graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Raster Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster data is any pixelated (or gridded) data where each pixel is associated with a specific geographical location. The value of a pixel can be continuous (e.g. elevation) or categorical (e.g. land use). \n",
    "\n",
    "If this sounds familiar, it is because this data structure is very common: it's how we represent any digital image. A geospatial raster is only different from a digital photo in that it is accompanied by spatial information that connects the data to a particular location. This includes the raster's extent and cell size, the number of rows and columns, and its coordinate reference system (or CRS).\n",

    "## What makes a raster geospatial?\n",
    "\n",
    "A raster is just an image in local pixel coordinates until we specify what part of the earth the image covers.  This is done through two pieces of metadata that accompany the pixel values of the image:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coordinate Reference System or \"CRS\"\n",
    "This specifies the datum, projection, and additional parameters needed to place the raster in geographic space. For a dedicated lesson on CRSs, see: \n",
    "[https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/03-crs/index.html](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/03-crs/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../assets/us_crs.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Affine Geotransformation \n",
    "\n",
    "This dictates the size, tilt and layout of the raster's pixels.  This is the essential matrix that relates the raster pixel coordinates (rows, columns) to the geographic coordiantes (x and y defined by the CRS). This is typically a 6-parameter matrix that defines the origin, pixel size and rotation of the raster in the geographic coordinate system:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Xgeo = GT(0) + Xpixel*GT(1) + Yline*GT(2)\n",
    "Ygeo = GT(3) + Xpixel*GT(4) + Yline*GT(5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Defining this for the whole image allows the image's pixels to be referenced by a local array index rather than global coordinates, and answers questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * How much area does a given pixel cover?\n",
    "    * Given the CRS, what is the origin?\n",
    "    * In what direction does the raster \"grow\" as pixel indices increase?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extent / BBOX\n",
    "\n",
    "The affine transformation specifies an \"extent\" or \"bounding box\", which is defined by the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resolution / Posting\n",
    "\n",
    "The affine transformation specifies a pixel size of the area on the ground that each pixel of the raster covers. This is often refered to as \"resolution\", but because images are often resampled to different resolutions it is also refered to as \"posting\" or \"ground sample distance (gsd)\". Ultimately, \"resolution\" refers to a sensors ability to distinguish different objects on the ground. The image below illustrates the effect of changes in resolution: \n",
